# AI Agents Instructions: Global Mandates

This repository defines a highly customized Google Cloud Workstation environment. Strict adherence to these global mandates is required for any AI agent.

## 1. Repository Management & Git Constraints

**CRITICAL MANDATE: Git is strictly READ-ONLY.**

As an AI agent, you must **NEVER** use `git` commands to manage the repository, branches, or commits, nor should you stage or push changes. Staging and committing are the exclusive responsibility of the human user.

You may use `git` exclusively for **read-only analysis** (`git status`, `git diff`, `git log`).

## 2. Agent Validation Lifecycle

Every technical change MUST follow this sequential workflow:

1.  **Stop Workstation**: Ensure the instance is in `STATE_STOPPED`.
2.  **Run Local Tests**: Execute `skills/validate-image-updates/scripts/run_local_tests.sh`.
3.  **Monitor Build**: Wait for the Cloud Build to reach `SUCCESS`.
4.  **Start Workstation**: Only after a successful build.
5.  **Run Integration Tests**: Execute integration suites on the live instance.
6.  **Persona Reviews**: Conduct in-depth persona reviews (UX, SEC, SRE, etc.) after validation.

## 3. Global Agent Skills (Foundation)

These global skills are available within the `skills/` directory:

- **`validate-image-updates`**: Enforces the mandatory 6-step validation workflow.
- **`persona-swe`**: Software Engineering mandates and history refactoring.
- **`persona-sre`**: System resilience and service orchestration.
- **`persona-security`**: Vulnerability auditing and system hardening.
- **`persona-ux`**: Design language, layout stability, and accessibility.
- **`persona-legal`**: Licensing, copyrights, and SBOM compliance.
- **`persona-oss`**: Upstream-first and community standards.
- **`persona-privacy`**: Data handling and privacy regulation compliance.
- **`persona-agent-manager`**: Skill lifecycle and agent orchestration.

## 4. Module-Specific Proximity Router

AI agents must follow local instructions when operating within a specific module:

- 👉 **[Preflight Dashboard (Frontend)](examples/preflight/AGENTS.md)**: SPA model, i18n standards, and local hot-patching.
- 👉 **[GNOME Desktop (Layer)](examples/images/gnome/AGENTS.md)**: Extension compatibility and systemd lifecycle.
