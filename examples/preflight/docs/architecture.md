# Preflight Layer Architecture

The Preflight layer is responsible for managing the user's initial connection experience while background services are still warming up. It provides a highly optimized loading interface and orchestrates the transition from "Booting" to "Ready."

## Layer Responsibility

This layer sits between the **Base OS** and the **Graphical Desktop**. Its primary job is to hide "Connection Refused" errors from the user and provide actionable feedback during the boot process.

| Feature               | Responsibility                                     | Technology                 |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **Frontend UI**       | Visual status and precision timer                  | Vite + Vanilla TypeScript  |
| **Readiness Probing** | Automated health checking of RDP/SSH ports         | XHR / Fetch polling        |
| **Traffic Control**   | Firewall management during early boot              | Nginx + `iptables`         |
| **Interception**      | Catching early traffic before the desktop is ready | Nginx `error_page` mapping |

## The "Hard Silence" Boot Sequence

Preflight implements a "Silent Retry" strategy to ensure a seamless transition:

1.  **Block Stage**: At container entry, all external traffic is dropped at the kernel level.
2.  **Internal Readiness**: Nginx starts and serves the Preflight UI on the loopback interface.
3.  **Permit Stage**: Once Nginx is locally reachable, the firewall is flushed. The user's browser now sees the loading screen instead of a timeout.
4.  **Backend Probing**: The UI (running in the user's browser) polls the workstation's `/healthz` endpoint.
5.  **Handover**: Once the desktop RDP port responds, the UI triggers an automatic redirect to the workstation's main interface.

## Frontend State Model (SPA)

The UI operates as a stateful Single Page Application, ensuring high performance and a seamless user experience:

- **Atomic State Singleton**: The application state is managed in a central `state` object (`types.ts`), ensuring a single source of truth.
- **Transient UI Staging**: To prevent data loss during navigation (e.g., from Settings to Language), the UI utilizes a `uiTransient` staging object. Unsaved changes are "snapshotted" during modal transitions and re-applied upon return.
- **Zero-Reload Configuration**: Savings settings updates the in-memory state and the browser history (`replaceState`) without triggering a page reload.

## Phased Health Monitoring

The health check cycle (`health_module.ts`) operates in two distinct phases:

1.  **Nominal Phase**: Polling occurs at a high frequency (customizable via the Retry Interval slider) to ensure rapid connection once ready.
2.  **Timeout Phase**: If the `timeoutMs` threshold is exceeded, the system transitions to an **Exponential Backoff** strategy (current \* 1.5, max 30s) to minimize backend load during extended startup periods.

## Frontend Module Structure

The UI is built as a set of decoupled TypeScript modules:

- `health_module.ts`: Phased polling logic and exponential backoff.
- `config_module.ts`: Management of settings, logarithmic mappings, and transient snapshots.
- `i18n_module.ts`: Hash-validated translation loading and DOM application.
- `ui_module.ts`: Modal stack management, adaptive layout logic, and event orchestration.
- `sbom_module.ts`: Dynamic license and component metadata rendering.
- `window_utils.ts`: Browser location and navigation abstraction layer to support testability under strict JSDOM security constraints.

## Internal Documentation Architecture

The Preflight dashboard utilizes a pre-rendered documentation pipeline to ensure a high-performance, self-contained experience. During the build phase, Markdown sources (e.g., `examples/preflight/docs/privacy_notice.md`) are converted into HTML fragments. This allows the Single Page Application (SPA) to fetch and render professional documentation internally without external dependencies or heavy client-side Markdown libraries.
