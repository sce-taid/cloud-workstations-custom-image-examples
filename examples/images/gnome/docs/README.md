# GNOME Layer Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation for the **GNOME Application Layer** of the Cloud Workstation blueprint.

## Documentation Standards

To ensure consistency and compatibility across the project, adhere to the following standards:

### File Naming

- **Convention**: Use `snake_case.md` for all technical documentation (e.g., `developer_guide.md`).
- **Rationale**: Ensures maximum compatibility with Linux environments, web servers, and consistent sorting in IDEs.
- **Exception**: Root-level files like `README.md` or `LICENSE` remain in UPPERCASE as per industry standard.

### Structure & Redundancy

- **Agnosticism**: Documentation in this directory should focus exclusively on the GNOME desktop environment, systemd orchestration, and RDP/Wayland configuration.
- **Linking**: Avoid duplicating information from base layers. Instead, refer to the documentation of parent or sibling layers where appropriate.

### README Strategy

- **Top-Level `README.md`**: Reserved for external consumption. Must contain a high-level overview, configuration variables (ARGs/ENVs), quick-start guides, and a link pointing developers to the `docs/` folder.
- **Internal `docs/README.md`**: Reserved for internal maintenance. Acts as the table of contents for technical deep-dives (`architecture.md`, `developer_guide.md`, etc.) and enforces layer-specific documentation rules.
