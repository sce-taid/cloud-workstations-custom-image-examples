# GNOME Layer Architecture

This document defines the technical architecture of the **GNOME Desktop Layer**. It focuses on graphical session orchestration, remote desktop protocols, and the transition from the base image to a functional desktop environment.

## Layer Responsibility

The GNOME layer is responsible for providing a performant, headless graphical environment within the workstation container. It sits on top of the **Base OS** and receives control after the **Preflight** readiness checks.

| Feature | Responsibility | Technology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Display Server** | Headless Wayland session | GNOME Shell + Mutter |
| **Remote Access** | Web-to-RDP Gateway | Apache Guacamole + `gnome-remote-desktop` |
| **Orchestration** | Service lifecycle and ordering | Native Systemd |
| **Authentication** | Ephemeral credential generation | OpenSSL + `envsubst` |

## Build-Time Orchestration

The image build process is managed by a centralized configuration script that provides standard extension points for child layers.

```mermaid

    Start[configure_workstation.sh] --> Assets[Prepare Assets & Permissions]
    Assets --> APT[Configure Regional APT]
    APT --> Update[apt-get update]
    Update --> BuildHooks{{"run_hooks /build-hooks.d/"}}
    BuildHooks --> PKG[Install EXTRA_PKGS]
    PKG --> DEB[Install EXTRA_DEB_URLS]
    DEB --> PostHooks{{"run_hooks /post-install-hooks.d/"}}
    PostHooks --> Desktop[desktop_apply_integration]
    Desktop --> Cleanup[Cleanup & Flatten]
```

1.  **Build-Time Hooks**: Executed *before* package installation. Used for repository setup, custom binary injection, or pre-requisite configuration.
2.  **Post-Install Hooks**: Executed *after* all packages are installed but *before* the desktop integration logic runs. This is the primary point for patching files provided by third-party `.deb` packages.

## Systemd Service Flow

The following diagram illustrates the dependency chain and execution order of the core system services.

    B -->|Triggers| C[config-rendering.service]
    C -->|Generates| D[ephemeral.env]
    D -->|Sourced by| E[user-setup.service]
    D -->|Sourced by| F["gnome-session@user.service"]
    E -->|Enables| G[just-perfection-extension]
    F -->|Starts| H[gnome-remote-desktop]
    H -->|Listens| I[Port 3389]
    J[permit-traffic.service] -->|Probes| K[Nginx Port 80]
    K -->|Redirects to| L[Preflight UI]
    L -->|Monitors| I
```

## The Startup Sequence (GNOME Focus)

GNOME orchestration is integrated into the broader workstation startup sequence.

```mermaid

    participant S as Systemd
    participant C as config-rendering.service
    participant G as gnome-session@user.service
    participant R as gnome-remote-desktop
    participant P as Preflight UI
    participant U as User Browser

    S->>C: Start Rendering
    C->>C: Generate Ephemeral Pass
    C->>C: Render user-mapping.xml
    C->>S: Finished
    S->>G: Start GNOME Session
    G->>R: Start RDP Daemon
    R->>R: Listen on 3389
    U->>P: Access Workstation
    P->>R: Check Port 3389
    Note over P,R: Health check loop
    R-->>P: Ready
    P->>U: Redirect to /guacamole
    U->>R: RDP Session Established
```

1.  **Rendering Stage**:
    *   `config-rendering.service` generates an ephemeral password.
    *   It renders the `user-mapping.xml` used by Guacamole to authenticate with the desktop.
2.  **Desktop Initialization**:
    *   `user-setup.service` configures the unprivileged user's environment.
    *   It unlocks the GNOME Keyring (using the ephemeral password) and configures the `just-perfection` extension to hide screen-sharing indicators.
3.  **Graphical Session**:
    *   `gnome-session@user.service` starts a headless Wayland shell.
    *   The `gnome-remote-desktop-daemon` begins listening on the RDP port (3389).
4.  **Gateway Handover**:
    *   The Preflight UI detects the active RDP listener.
    *   The browser is automatically redirected to the Guacamole endpoint, which proxys the RDP session to the user.

## Architectural Components

```mermaid

    subgraph "Workstation Container"
        A[Nginx] -->|Proxy| B[Guacamole Client]
        B -->|RDP/SSH| C[Guacamole Server - guacd]
        C -->|RDP| D[GNOME Remote Desktop]
        D <--> E[GNOME Shell - Headless]
        F[config-rendering.service] -->|Render| B
    end
    U[User Browser] -->|HTTPS| A
```

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Native Systemd Handoff
This layer utilizes a declarative systemd pattern (`multi-user.target.d/10-workstation.conf`) to ensure all graphical services are enabled without manual script management.

### 2. Headless Performance
To maintain low latency and high stability in a containerized environment, the GNOME layer:
*   Forces software rendering (`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`) to avoid GPU compatibility issues.
*   Uses a dedicated systemd user drop-in to force the shell into `--headless` mode.

### 3. Ephemeral Security
Credentials for the RDP session are generated uniquely for every workstation start and are never persisted to disk beyond the lifetime of the container.

## Cross-Layer Dependencies

*   **Preflight (Parent)**: This layer relies on the Nginx configuration provided by the Preflight stage to intercept early traffic and provide the loading experience.
*   **AI Integration & Gemini CLI**: The blueprint natively includes the **Gemini CLI** as a core component for developer productivity, automation, and persona-driven development, providing context-aware AI assistance directly within the terminal.
*   **Downstream Apps (Children)**: Higher-level layers (like Antigravity) integrate with this layer via two mechanisms:
    *   **Build-time Hooks** (`assets/build-hooks.d/`): To install additional tools and perform pre-installation setup.
    *   **Post-Install Hooks** (`assets/post-install-hooks.d/`): To patch or configure system files after package installation but before final desktop integration.
