# Cloud Workstations Custom Image Examples

This repository contains examples intended to help you get started creating [customized container images](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/customize-container-images) for use on [Cloud Workstations](https://cloud.google.com/workstations). The examples provided demonstrate how to extend various Cloud Workstations preconfigured base images to integrate various VDI technologies, IDEs, and other development resources and tooling.

The examples provided are intended as samples only, and are not stable across updates. We recommend forking into a stable repository before deploying.  Additionally, we recommend you follow standard [best practices](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/set-up-security-best-practices) when utilizing Cloud Workstations, including [rebuilding weekly](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/tutorial-automate-container-image-rebuild) to pick up security updates.
