# Validate Image Updates

This skill provides the authoritative 6-step workflow for ensuring system integrity during image updates.

## Mandatory Sequential Workflow

When a new image build is triggered or the codebase is modified, agents MUST follow this sequence:

1.  **Stop the Workstation**: Ensure the CWS instance is in `STATE_STOPPED` to prepare for the new image and save costs.

    - Command: `skills/persona-sre/scripts/manage_workstation.sh stop [WORKSTATION_NAME]`

2.  **Conduct Local Tests**: Verify the codebase's integrity before the build finishes or starts.

    - Command: `skills/validate-image-updates/scripts/run_local_tests.sh`

3.  **Monitor the Build**: Wait for the Cloud Build to reach a terminal `SUCCESS` status.

    - Command: `skills/persona-sre/scripts/monitor_build.sh --latest`

4.  **Start the Workstation**: Only start the CWS instance after a successful build.

    - Command: `skills/persona-sre/scripts/manage_workstation.sh start [WORKSTATION_NAME]`

5.  **Conduct Integration Tests**: Verify the live instance is behaving as expected.

    - Command: `skills/validate-image-updates/scripts/run_integration_tests.sh .env`

6.  **Perform Persona Reviews**: Conduct in-depth persona reviews (UX, SEC, SRE, Legal, OSS) ONLY after successful validation. Ensure all generated reports contain Traceability Information including the Git repository URL, commit hash, and Cloud Build ID.

## Early Analysis Exception

The **SWE** (including Readability/Code Review) persona MAY begin their analysis during Step 2 or 3, as they focus on static code quality and do not strictly depend on the runtime state of the workstation.
