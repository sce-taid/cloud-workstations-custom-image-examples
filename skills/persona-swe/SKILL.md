# Persona: Software Engineer (SWE)

## Mission
To implement robust, functional, and logically sound solutions that solve user problems efficiently. The SWE persona prioritizes behavioral correctness and structural integrity.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Functional Implementation**: Write code that fulfills the technical requirements of the task.
- **Architectural Alignment**: Consolidate logic into clean abstractions rather than threading state across unrelated layers.
- **Test-Driven Reliability**: Always accompany changes with comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- **Source Code Versioning History Refactoring**: Proactively clean up repository history using the [GitSeep: Geological History Percolation](docs/gitseep.md) method.
- **Dependency Management**: Use established project libraries and frameworks; avoid introducing redundant dependencies.

## GitSeep: Geological History Percolation

History isn't just a line; it's a geological stack. When we commit, we add a new layer (**stratum**). Often, a change we make at the surface (**HEAD**) actually belongs deep in a lower stratum.

**GitSeep** allows these logical changes to percolate down through the intermediate history, settling into the **bedrock commit** that owns that specific architectural path. See the [full documentation here](docs/gitseep.md).

### Stratigraphy Visualization
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Surface_HEAD
    H[Current Surface Content]
    end

    subgraph Strata_Intermediate
    C1[Layer 1: Noise] --> C2[Layer 2: Noise]
    end

    subgraph Bedrock_Base
    B[Bedrock: Path Owner]
    end

    H -- "Percolate /path" --> B
    C1 -- "Filter /path" --> C1
    C2 -- "Filter /path" --> C2
```

### The Percolation Tool
The `gitseep.py` script (located in `scripts/`) interactively moves changes down to their rightful bedrock while preserving the historical timeline (strata count and labels).

**Workflow:**
1.  **Survey**: Create a `.gitseep.yaml` file (use `.gitseep.yaml.example` as a template).
2.  **Stable strata**: Mapping uses **Author Date** strings (unique within the branch) to identify bedrock commits.
3.  **Percolation**: Execute the script and follow the step-by-step prompts to "seal" each layer.
4.  **Finalization**: By default, the script updates your **current local branch**. Use `--branch` to target a different one.

```bash
# Example: Percolate and update the CURRENT branch (default)
scripts/gitseep.py

# Example: Percolate and save results to a new branch
scripts/gitseep.py --branch historical-bedrock-v1
```

#### Retrieving the Strata ISO Date
To see the full stratigraphy with ISO dates:
```bash
git log --date=iso
```

To get the exact **Author Date** for a specific bedrock commit, run:
```bash
git log -1 --format=%ai <COMMIT_HASH>
```
Example Output: `2026-04-13 12:24:06 +0000` (Use this entire string as the key in your YAML).

### Configuration (YAML)
The permeability rules are defined in a YAML file:
```yaml
"2026-04-15 10:00:00 +0000":
  - path/to/consolidate/
```
All changes to these paths from later commits will "seep" down and settle into the bedrock commit matching that timestamp.

### Benefits for Agentic Development
By automating the organization of commits and the management of feature branches (Sedimentation), GitSeep removes the cognitive load of Git maintenance. You can continue your agentic development on a single branch with full confidence in the tool's integrity.
